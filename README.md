This data analytics project leverages Python for data analysis and preprocessing, coupled with Power BI for dynamic and interactive visualization. Focused on optimizing industrial equipment performance, the project utilizes historical data and sensor readings. Python is employed for comprehensive data preprocessing, ensuring data quality and cleanliness. The project also involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) with Python to derive meaningful insights. The integration with Power BI comes into play for creating visually compelling dashboards and reports, making the insights accessible and actionable. The combined use of Python and Power BI aims to provide a robust solution for industrial equipment health monitoring, contributing to improved operational efficiency through data-driven decision-making.
